# Client API

### You can find the OpenAPI / swagger definition [here](/openapi)

TBD: NPM link

We provide a Typescript client for ease of use from Javascript, we also provide an OpenAPI / Swagger definition. This helps with

- Writing clients for other languages
- Having human-readable documentation for the API

If you want to write your own client, you can refer to the [sql format](../indexer/sql.mdx)

## Example

Here are some examples of common use-cases

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="example.ts" showLineNumbers>
  {MyComponentSource}
</CodeBlock>
