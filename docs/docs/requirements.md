# Minimum requirements

- Minimum RAM: 16GBs+
- vCPUs: 4+
- Storage: 256GBs+ (this depends on how many tasks you use)

If you are running a Carp client as well, you may need to increase the requirements to adequately serve all the traffic you get.

Part of this is due to the minimum requirements to run a `cardano-node` instance. You may be able to use lower minimum requirements if you are hosting cardano-node on a separate machine. You can find the requirements for running `cardano-node` [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases)
